Task
Given an array, , of size  distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following  lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where  is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement
where  is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement
where  is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of elements in array .
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of .

Constraints

, where .
Output Format

Print the following three lines of output:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where  is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement
where  is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement
where  is the last element in the sorted array.
Sample Input 0

3
1 2 3
Sample Output 0

Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
